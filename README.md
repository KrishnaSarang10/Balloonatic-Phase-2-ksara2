While developing this website I leaned about Node.js and used this open source platform to execute and test Javascript code on server side.
As back end service I used Express.js to framework.
Main trouble using it was that sometimes it takes time and crashes as well.
I have covered and learned to write some of the most basic as well as important which is creating registrations module make user to create its account for better experience and if they have account then log in them.
In Task-3 it would be asked to make user buy things as it is considered as business website I would like to add payment and cart modules.
