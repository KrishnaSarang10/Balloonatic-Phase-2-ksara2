Transport balloons have a basket or container hung below for passengers or cargo. A self-propelled steerable balloon is called an airship or a dirigible."

Experimentation with balloonlike craft may have begun as early as 1709 with the work of Bartolomeu LourenÃ§o de GusmÃ£o, a Brazilian priest and inventor. In 1783 Joseph and Ã‰tienne Montgolfier at Annonay, France, confirmed that a fabric bag filled with hot air would rise. On June 4 of that year they launched an unmanned balloon that traveled more than 1.5 miles (2.4 km). At Versailles they repeated the experiment with a larger balloon on September 19, 1783, sending a sheep, rooster, and duck aloft."
